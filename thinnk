first i make an object

const o1 = {
    a:{
        b:{
            c:10
        }
    }
}

if i want to deep clone it it might not gonna happen directly through {...o1} or Object.assign({},o1)

so for that we must have to make our own func.

first lets destructure it 
- o1[a][b][c] we have to do like this or we can use recursion.

-> so lets check the value of a , if its object then iterate through for loop.
-> if value of b is also an object then do same process until its not an object.
